# Supply Chain Management System

This project was developed as part of my CS 102 course at Özyeğin University in Spring 2025. The objective was to create a Supply Chain Management System in Java, incorporating key object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, abstract classes, and exception handling. The system simulates the full flow of a supply chain — from raw material producers to factories, markets, and finally, customers — with functionality for registering entities, managing inventory, designing and producing products, setting prices, and handling purchases. A major focus of the project was building a fully functional GUI using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. I faced significant challenges while implementing the GUI, but overcame them with persistence and occasional help from Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview.
